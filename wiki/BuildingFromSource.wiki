=Prequisites=

  * C++ Compiler
  * Irrlicht Library
  * Linux only: QtCreator (or Qmake) 

=Linux=

You need Qt4 installed if you want to build yourself - not because it's using Qt, i just use QtCreator for doing the development and this IDE uses Qmake as it's built system.

To generate a working makefile, edit the .pro file to reflect your path settings and run:

{{{
qmake
make -f Makefile.Debug
}}}

this will (hopfully) build a binary in the "build" subdirectory.

=Windows=

In the "win32" folder of your source tree there's a VC++2010 Solution. Open it up and edit the properties to reflect the correct path to the Irrlicht Library. After building, you end up with a "win32_build" folder in the source tree which contains the win32 binary. 

Additionally you have to manually copy the arial*.* and *.b3d files from the linux build directory to the output folder
