# Changelog

## [git] - 2019-03-09
(poikilos)
### Added
* completed rotation controls (Blender-like)
* pan up and down (Blender-like, but only up and down)
* Z or Y to switch ("up" axis)
* change up axis to Z when 3ds is loaded
* model-ms3d.xml mime type file

## [git] - 2019-03-09
(poikilos)
### Added
* hotkeys to reload model/texture
* license (see README.md for licensing history)

### Changed
* only try to load png or jpg textures--skip others when cycling
* cycle backwards correctly
* fix some of the header creep (remove unecessary includes in h files)
* improve initial camera position and angle (see top of characters since
  camera is higher; z-forward characters face camera at an angle)
* Clarify relationship between camera start position in m_Engine and
  m_View's rotation (m_Pitch and m_Yaw). Now, `setNewCameraPosition`
  operates on view correctly (relatively) no matter where camera starts.

## [git] - 2019-03-07
(poikilos)
### Added
* playback controls

## [git] - 2019-03-06
(poikilos)
### Added
* created install.sh and install.bat, and added Install and Usage
  to README.md
* icon, install scripts, and mime type (`model/b3d`)--see README.md
* mime type (`model/x`)
* added ClearSansRegular.ttf
* hotkeys to cycle ../textures/*

### Changed
* The program can now start without "test.b3d" in the current working
  directory (fixed Segmentation Fault).
* set `TARGET = b3view` in B3View.pro, so that binary is lowercase as
  per usual Linux naming conventions.
* check for font load failure properly, and load properly if succeeds
* check for "ClearSansRegular.ttf" instead of "arial.ttf"
* move `using namespace` directives from `h` files and specify upon use,
  as per C++ best practices; add directives to `cpp` files only as
  needed (removed cumulative namespace creep).

## [git-94e3b8f] - 2019-03-06
(poikilos)
### Added
* README.md

### Changed
(CGUITTFont methods are in CGUITTFont class unless otherwise specified)
* fixed instances of "0 as null pointer constant" (changed to `nullptr`)
* changed inconsistent use of spaces and tabs (changed tabs to 4 spaces)
* (UserInterface.cpp) fixed "logical not is only applied to the left
  hand side of this comparison..." (put parenthesis around
  `event.EventType == EET_GUI_EVENT`)
* Silently degrade to pixel font if font file cannot be read (fixes
  Segmentation Fault when font file cannot be read).
  * check for nullptr before using:
    * (CGUITTFont.cpp) `tt_face->face` in `getWidthFromCharacter`,
      `getGlyphByChar` (return 0 as bad as per convention:
      existing code already checks for 0--see
      `getWidthFromCharacter`), `getKerningWidth`,
      `draw`, `attach` (also don't copy null by
      reference there--instead, set to nullptr if source is nullptr)
  * check length of array before using
    * (CGUITTFont.cpp) elements of `Glyph` array (type
      `core::array<CGUITTGlyph>`) in `getHeightFromCharacter`
  * (CGUITTFont.cpp) check whether file can be read in
    `CGUITTFace::load` before proceeding

### Removed
* arial.tff removed, since it may be the "real" Arial font, which has a
  proprietary license

## [git-d964384] - 2019-03-06
